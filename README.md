# Wytham_AshDieback

This deposit gives codes of a currently unpublished manuscript "The Complexity Of Forecasting Local Extinction Risk: The Case Of Ash Dieback in Wytham Woods", which looks at the serverity of ash dieback in Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, and also develops an epidemiological model to predict the future dynamics of ash population.

Code files include:
* 'PLOT-1-ash-dieback-mortality.R': visualise mortality data observed during 2021-2022 at Wytham Woods. Data is currently not uploaded though.
* 'PLOT-1-ash-dieback-regeneration.R': visualise seed production data observed from Sep 2020 to Jan 2023. Data is currently not uploaded though.
* 'PLOT-1-ash-dieback-sapling-ratio.R': used to calculate sapling ratio based on sensus data from 2021-2022. Data is currently not uploaded though.
* 'PLOT-1-ash-dieback-severity.R': visualise incidence rate of ash dieback recorded in July 13th 2022. Data is currently not uploaded though.
* 'CALC-2-1-fit-model-parameters.R': code for fitting the epidemiological model.
* 'CALC-2-2-model-prediction.R': code for predicting ash dieback dynamics using the fitted epidemiological model.
* 'CALC-2-3-resistant-trees.R': code for exploring effect of resistant trees on ash dieback dynamics using the fitted epidemiological model.
